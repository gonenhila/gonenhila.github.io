I am an Assistant Professot of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at the [University of Biritish Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My long-term vision is transforming LLMs into responsible, reliable and trustworthy systems, which are available and fair across languages and different socio-demographic groups. In my research, I focus on three main threads: (1) Control and interpretation of models: understanding model behavior and controlling model generation; (2) Reliability, safety and fairness: making models more consistent and safe, and mitigating biases and risks; (3) Multilinguality: creating NLP tools that equitably serve speakers of as many languages as possible, as well as understanding the emergent property of cross-linguality in models. Additionally, I have recently developed an interest in employing NLP tools and methodologies in the health domain. 

Before joining UBC, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), at Meta AI and at Amazon. Prior to that I did my Ph.D in Computer Science at the [NLP lab at Bar Ilan University](https://biu-nlp.github.io/). I obtained my Ms.C. in Coputer Science from the [Hebrew University](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/).

**Note for prospective students**: I will be recruiting graduate students this coming cycle for the fall of 2026. The deadline is December 15 2025, and you should apply [directly to the department](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective). Please do not email me directly. If you are interested in working with me, simply mention my name in your application.
