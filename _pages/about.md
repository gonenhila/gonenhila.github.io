I am a postdoctoral Researcher at Meta AI and at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). My research focuses on multilingual NLP, both from the perspective of modeling and from the perspective of analysis. I also work on promoting fairness in NLP, focusing mainly on gender bias identification and mitigation.

Before joining UW and Meta AI, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Amazon. Prior to that I did my Ph.D in Computer Science at the [NLP lab at Bar Ilan University](https://biu-nlp.github.io/). I obtained my Ms.C. in Coputer Science from the [Hebrew University](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/).
